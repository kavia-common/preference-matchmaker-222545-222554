Date: 2025-12-21

Analyzer excerpt from CI (latest):
5 issues found (ran in ~1.3s)

Errors:
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart:3:8 — uri_does_not_exist: 'package:preference_frontend/main.dart'
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart:8:37 — creation_with_non_type: The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart:18:37 — creation_with_non_type: The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart:29:37 — creation_with_non_type: The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart:36:37 — creation_with_non_type: The name 'MyApp' isn't a class

Root cause:
- Missing lib/ sources referenced by tests, notably lib/main.dart exposing MyApp (and MyHomePage).

Notes:
- This file captures the reduced 5-error snapshot reported by CI for quick triage.
- Only automated tooling was applied in this task; no manual source files were added.
- Implement lib/main.dart (with MyApp/MyHomePage) to clear these, then re-run analyze.
