Command executed by CI:
  dart analyze .

Result:
  5 issues found (blocking)

Details:
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart
  • 3:8  uri_does_not_exist  Target of URI doesn't exist: 'package:preference_frontend/main.dart'
  • 8:37 creation_with_non_type The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 18:37 creation_with_non_type The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 29:37 creation_with_non_type The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 36:37 creation_with_non_type The name 'MyApp' isn't a class

Notes:
- Remaining errors are due to a missing lib/main.dart (MyApp, MyHomePage). This aligns with earlier findings that lib/ sources are not present.
- Per task scope, no manual source additions were made; only automated formatting and fixes were applied.

Next steps (out of scope for this task):
- Create lib/main.dart exposing MyApp and (optionally) MyHomePage.
- Re-run: flutter pub get; dart analyze .; flutter test
