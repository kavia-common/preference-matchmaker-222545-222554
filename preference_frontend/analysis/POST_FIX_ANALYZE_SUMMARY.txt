Automated steps executed:
1) flutter pub get — success
2) dart format . — success (no changes on latest run)
3) dart fix --apply — success (no safe fixes available)
4) dart analyze . — 47 issues found (blocking)

Top remaining issues:
- uri_does_not_exist (missing lib/ sources referenced by tests):
  • package:preference_frontend/main.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/models/filter_criteria.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/state/filter_provider.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/screens/filter_screen.dart

- Undefined / non-type symbols (cascade from missing sources):
  • MyApp, MyHomePage
  • FilterProvider
  • FilterCriteria, Range, Race, HairColor, Religion
  • FilterScreen

Hotspot test files:
- test/navigation/test_navigation_test.dart
- test/screens/filter_screen_test.dart
- test/state/filter_provider_test.dart
- test/widget_test.dart
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart

Notes:
- As requested, only automated formatting and safe fixes were applied; no manual code edits were performed.
- Analyzer errors persist due to missing application sources under lib/. Implement those sources to clear remaining issues.

Next actions (outside this formatting task):
- Implement minimal versions of:
  • lib/main.dart
  • lib/models/filter_criteria.dart
  • lib/state/filter_provider.dart
  • lib/screens/filter_screen.dart
- Re-run:
  flutter pub get
  dart format .
  dart analyze .
  dart fix --apply
  flutter test
