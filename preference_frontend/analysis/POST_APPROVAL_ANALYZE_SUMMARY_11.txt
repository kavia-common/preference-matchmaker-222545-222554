Date: 2025-12-21

Command executed by CI:
  dart analyze .

Result:
  5 issues found (blocking)

Details:
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart
  • 3:8   uri_does_not_exist      Target of URI doesn't exist: 'package:preference_frontend/main.dart'
  • 8:37  creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 18:37 creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 29:37 creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 36:37 creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class

Notes:
- Errors persist because lib/main.dart is missing (expected to export MyApp, optionally MyHomePage).
- Within this task, only automated formatting and safe fixes were executed; no new source files were added.

Suggested next steps (outside current scope):
1) Create lib/main.dart with MyApp (and MyHomePage if required by tests).
2) Re-run:
   - flutter pub get
   - dart format .
   - dart analyze .
   - flutter test
