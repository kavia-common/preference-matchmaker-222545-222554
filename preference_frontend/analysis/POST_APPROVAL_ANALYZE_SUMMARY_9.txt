  • 3:8   uri_does_not_exist      Target of URI doesn't exist: 'package:preference_frontend/main.dart'
  • 8:37  creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 18:37 creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 29:37 creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class
  • 36:37 creation_with_non_type  The name 'MyApp' isn't a class

Notes:
- Errors persist due to missing lib/main.dart expected to define MyApp (and possibly MyHomePage).
- Within this task, only automated formatting and safe fixes were applied; no new source files were created.

Next steps (outside this task scope):
1) Create lib/main.dart implementing MyApp (and MyHomePage if required).
2) Re-run:
   - flutter pub get
   - dart format .
   - dart analyze .
   - flutter test
