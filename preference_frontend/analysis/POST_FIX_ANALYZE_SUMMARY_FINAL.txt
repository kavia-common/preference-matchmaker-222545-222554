Post-Fix Analyze Summary — preference_frontend (Final for this task)
Date: 2025-12-21

Automated steps executed (per instructions):
1) flutter pub get — success
2) dart format . — success (no changes on latest run)
3) dart fix --apply — success (no safe fixes available)
4) dart analyze . — 47 issues found (blocking)

Primary remaining issues:
- uri_does_not_exist (missing lib/ sources referenced by tests):
  • package:preference_frontend/main.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/models/filter_criteria.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/state/filter_provider.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/screens/filter_screen.dart

- Undefined/non-type symbols (cascade from missing sources):
  • MyApp, MyHomePage
  • FilterProvider
  • FilterCriteria, Range, Race, HairColor, Religion
  • FilterScreen

Hotspot files:
- test/navigation/test_navigation_test.dart
- test/screens/filter_screen_test.dart
- test/state/filter_provider_test.dart
- test/widget_test.dart
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart

Notes:
- This step intentionally made no manual source edits; only automated formatting and safe fixes were applied.
- The analyzer errors are expected until the missing lib/ sources are implemented.
- See analysis/STATUS.md, TODO_NEXT_STEPS.txt, and TROUBLESHOOTING_CI_LINTS.md for next actions and context.
