Latest status (short):
- Automated steps completed (pub get, format, fix).
- dart analyze reports 47 issues, all cascading from missing lib/ sources referenced by tests.

Next action (outside formatting scope):
- Implement required lib/ files (main.dart, models/filter_criteria.dart, state/filter_provider.dart, screens/filter_screen.dart), then re-run analyzer.
