Commands executed:
  1) flutter pub get
  2) dart format .
  3) dart fix --apply

Tool outputs:
- flutter pub get: Completed successfully (dependencies resolved).
- dart format .: Formatted 7 files (0 changed on this run).
- dart fix --apply: Nothing to fix (no safe fixes applicable).
- dart analyze .: 47 issues found.

Summary of remaining issues (top categories):
- uri_does_not_exist (missing package imports):
  • package:preference_frontend/main.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/models/filter_criteria.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/screens/filter_screen.dart
  • package:preference_frontend/state/filter_provider.dart

- Undefined/non-type symbols (cascade from missing sources):
  • MyApp, MyHomePage
  • FilterProvider
  • FilterScreen
  • FilterCriteria, Range, Race, HairColor, Religion

Hotspot files:
- test/navigation/test_navigation_test.dart
- test/screens/filter_screen_test.dart
- test/state/filter_provider_test.dart
- test/widget_test.dart
- test/widgets/test_main_widgets_test.dart

Notes:
- As requested, no manual code edits were made; only automated formatting/fixes were applied.
- The analyzer continues to report errors due to missing application sources under lib/ referenced by tests.
- This is expected until the following files are implemented:
  • lib/main.dart
  • lib/models/filter_criteria.dart
  • lib/state/filter_provider.dart
  • lib/screens/filter_screen.dart

Next actions (outside this formatting step):
- Implement the missing lib/ sources listed above.
- Re-run:
    flutter pub get
    dart format .
    dart analyze .
    dart fix --apply
    flutter test
